Optionally set the user's password to this crypted value. See the user example in the github examples directory for what this looks like in a playbook. See http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/faq.html#how-do-i-generate-crypted-passwords-for-the-user-module for details on various ways to generate these password values. Note on Darwin system, this value has to be cleartext. Beware of security issues.
